I am a final year PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research centers around causal inference, with an emphasis on developing methods for observational studies that integrate machine learning. My methodological work is motivated by problems in environmental health, public policy, and development economics. Previously, I received a B.A. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
