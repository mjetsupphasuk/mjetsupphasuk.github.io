I am a 4th year PhD Student in Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My statistical research interests include causal inference, spatial/network statistics, and nonparametric estimation / machine learning. My substantive interests are wide-ranging but include environmental health, healthy policy, and development economics.
