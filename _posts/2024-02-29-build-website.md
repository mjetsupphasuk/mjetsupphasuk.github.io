As part of the Biostatistics Student Association at UNC, I held a workshop for students on building an academic website (which resulted in what you see here). I essentially just converted Rob Williams' excellent [post](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/) into slides which can be downloaded [here](/files/Workshop_website.pdf).
